# StandBlog

StandBlog is a practice project developed to allow users to publish their own articles online. This project was built as part of a training exercise, with a primary focus on the backend. As a result, the user interface (UI) was not given much attention, and some parts of the code may not fully adhere to best practices. Additionally, I learned Git during this project—so early commit messages were not very systematic.

## Features

**Note:** Its core functionality centers on backend processes and basic blog publishing capabilities.

- **User Registration and Authentication:** Users can sign up, log in, and manage their profiles.
- **Article Publishing:** Authenticated users can create, edit, and publish their articles.
- **Categorization and Tagging:** Articles can be categorized and tagged for easier navigation.
- **Responsive Design:** Although a template is used, the UI improvements were minimal.

## Technical Overview

StandBlog is built using Django, a high-level Python web framework that follows the Model-View-Template (MVT) architecture. Key technical aspects include:

- **Backend Focus:** The project prioritizes backend functionality over UI design.
- **Learning Experience:** This project served as a training exercise where I gained practical experience with Django and Git; early commit messages were not standardized.
- **Basic Blog Functionality:** Despite being a practice project, it demonstrates essential blogging features.

## Project Purpose

This project was created purely for educational purposes. StandBlog provides a hands-on opportunity for developers to apply theoretical knowledge in a real-world context. It is not intended for production use but serves as a foundation for understanding web development with Django.

## Template and Design

The project is based on the Stand Blog template available at [TemplateMo Stand Blog](https://templatemo.com/tm-551-stand-blog). However, modifications were made to emphasize backend development, and UI enhancements were kept to a minimum.

## Future Improvements

Possible future improvements include:

- Refining the codebase to follow best practices more closely.
- Enhancing the UI for a more polished front-end experience.

## Conclusion

StandBlog is a valuable learning exercise that helped me strengthen my backend development skills with Django. It underscores the importance of practical experience—even if some parts of the code are not perfectly optimized.
